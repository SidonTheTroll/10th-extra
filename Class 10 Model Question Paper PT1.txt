1. Read the passage given below:								(1*8=8)

      Fish keeping has benefits that make it an attractive hobby for millions of people . Aquariums can bring a bit of nature, a living ecosystem, into any home, including apartments that do not allow other pets. like tending a furry animal, helping to maintain a fish tank can teach a child the responsibility of caring for other living creatures.
      As pets fish have distinct advantages: they are quiet, they do not chew or scratch the furniture, and with a few slow -release feeders in their tank ,they can safely be left alone for a week or two.
      But it is likely the documented benefit to human health that has helped make aquariums so popular .like petting a dog or cat , gazing at an aquarium at the end of a long, hard day can reduce stress and lower blood pressure. Likewise, research shows that people waiting to see a doctor or undergo medical procedure were less anxious after watching fish swimming in a tank. Watching fish also has a significant calming effect on children with attention deficit as well as on elderly people with Alzheimer's disease.
      Today, home aquariums became popular as commercial fish breeding operations and air transport made iteasy and affordable. More durable tanks and improved filtration system enabled hobbyists to sustain fish for longer periods.
      Today, home aquariums range from a child's goldfish bowl to elaborate tanks holding several hundred gallons of water and dozens of exotic fish. more adventurous hobbyists opt for saltwater tanks ,which take more work and equipment to maintain a stable environment .saltwater fish are more costly and more susceptible to changes in temperature and water quality than freshwater species .on the positive side ,they are spectacularly colorful and turn a tank into a dramatic focal point.
      Modern aquariums have evolved far beyond the boring rectangular tank. Today's models come in almost anyshape imaginable -round hexagonal, bow front .concave ,free form and flat to hang on the wall .they also have become key elements in home and office decor .they are built into walls and incorporated into tables ,lamps ,desks and even bath tubs. Almost any object it seems can be turned into a fish tank.

On the basis of your reading of the passage answer the following questions:

a) Why do people prefer keeping fish as a pet?
b) What are the special advantages of petting fish?
c) How does fish-keeping control high blood pressure?
d) Why is salt water tank used sometimes for keeping fish?
