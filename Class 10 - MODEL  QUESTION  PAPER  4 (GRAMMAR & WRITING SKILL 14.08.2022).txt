TIME: 45 MINUTES								TOTAL MARKS: 25


1. Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow:				(10)

      Literacy means "ability to read and write", the acting of being educated. Literacy is an essential need for development. The countries with low literacy rate have economically failed and their progress is very slow. The personality of an individual is polished if he or she is educated, but an illiterate person can be disrespected in society. The value of literacy can be imagined by taking the example of some African areas where literacy rate is much below average; therefore they are still working as the slaves of other countries.
      To produce sense and awareness about the value of literacy and education, United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) announced to celebrate International Literacy Day 8th September every years. This was decided in 1965 and from 1966 to onwards, this day is celebrated each year on 8th September. Every year UNO organises conferences and seminars to highlight the importance of literacy. Government of all countries also organise programmes and expeditions to create awareness in people about literacy. Governments force people to get necessary education and send their children to school. Literacy programmes are also organised on school adn college basis, where the students present speeches and models to demonstrate the value of literacy.
      Parents have an important role in the development of children, but if the parents are illiterate, they are not able to cope with the needs of new country, so their children suffer. So programmes must be organised to teach the parents to read and write. Such steps must be taken so that any child should not be deprived of going to school. It is their right to get education. We should promise ourselves on this International Literacy Day, that we will be the part of a literacy campaign.
